The Hiveway Android Client source code is forked from Tusky (https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky)

It currently has the following differences over Tusky:

- Refactor tusky packages to hiveway
- Change branding from tusky to hiveway
- Make the default domain hiveway.net
- Remove ability to work with multiple accounts
- Make the Light theme the default theme
